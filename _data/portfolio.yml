  description: >
    I originally built this API reference documentation with Widdershins and Shins but later wrote a custom Node.JS and Nunjucks program to generate it.
    It merges handwritten examples and task-based information about using the API with generated examples and endpoint reference from an OpenAPI source file.

    By providing clear and thorough information for partners using the Shutterstock API, this reference information reduced the average partner integration time from 3 months to 1.2 months.

  description: >
    This documentation covers many of the same topics as the API reference but is aimed at decision-makers and architects.
    Along with information about using the API, JavaScript SDK, and CLI, I've added a tutorial and information that helps Shutterstock's enterprise clients allow their employees to access Shutterstock through single sign-on.
    I didn't build this platform, but I expanded it as the content grew, and I wrote most of the content.

    This tutorial covers using the reverse image search and keyword suggestion features of our computer vision services.
    It includes end-to-end instructions on setting up a free API account, installing the Shutterstock JavaScript SDK, and writing straightforward Node.JS programs to analyze user-submitted images.
    I researched and wrote all of the content.

  description: >
    This tutorial covers the end-to-end process of searching, licensing, and downloading images with a free API subscription, requiring no credit card or other prerequisites. It covers what the API can be used for, how our partners use it, and how it provides licensed images.
    The tutorial includes instructions for Postman, cURL, the Shutterstock CLI, and the Shutterstock JavaScript SDK.
    I researched and wrote all of the content.

  description: >
    I planned, wrote, and typeset this white paper based on testing data from our product development teams.
    I consulted with the performance testers about what the test results meant and with the customer-facing teams that needed to explain the performance of the product to current and potential customers.

    This video addresses customer confusion that I learned about from support requests.
    It demonstrates techniques for reversing problems automatically, and it teaches customers about a common misconception about the product at the same time.
    I researched, wrote, and recorded the video.
  followup: >
    Our internal support call analysis showed significantly fewer customer issues in this area after I delivered and promoted the video.
