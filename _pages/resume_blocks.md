<div class="exp-title">API reference</div>
Developed and wrote <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">documentation for Shutterstock's public API</a>, SDK, CLI, and UI widgets by creating a pipeline to merge OpenAPI reference with manually written examples and task-oriented content.

<div class="result-title">Result</div>
These docs reduced average partner integration time from 3 months to 1.2 months.
Partner feedback indicates that documentation is a major factor in getting integrations working quickly.

<div id="s5" class="block experience">
<div class="exp-title">Documentation pipeline</div>
Developed and maintained a modular documentation container that builds and publishes documentation for technical teams via GitHub Actions.
Coded the container, pipeline, deployment code, and tests using Gatsby, GraphQL, React, GitHub Actions, asynchronous JavaScript, and other open-source tools.
</div>

<div id="s6" class="block result">
<div class="result-title">Result</div>
I onboarded documentation for 5 internal services onto this system in 2 months and eventually 13 services.
Overall, this container reduced the time that teams had to spend on tech docs because I could manage one platform instead of making them manage 13.
</div>

<div id="s7" class="block experience">
<div class="exp-title">Architecture diagram</div>
Built a diagram of Shutterstock's internal architecture, gathering information from each department and merging it into a format that makes sense across all departments.

<div id="s8" class="block result">
<div class="result-title">Result</div>
Departments across the company use this diagram to diagnose outages and other urgent situations.
</div>

<div id="s9" class="block experience">
<div class="exp-title">Microservice documentation</div>
Documented internal Node.JS microservices and APIs to promote innersourcing and accelerate onboarding.
Hosted writing classes and working sessions to guide teams to make documenting their work part of their processes.
</div>

<div id="s10" class="block result">
<div class="result-title">Result</div>
These tech docs reduced confusion when development teams worked across departments, reduced the amount of time experienced developers had to answer questions, and sped up the onboarding of new developers.
