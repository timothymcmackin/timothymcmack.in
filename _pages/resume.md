</ul>

<ul class="experience">
<li>
<div class="experienceActionBullet">
Drove a culture of information sharing and introduced technical documentation processes as Shutterstock's first technical writer.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="experienceActionBullet">
Developed and wrote <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">documentation for Shutterstock's public API</a>, including its SDK, CLI, and UI widgets:

<ul>
<li>
Wrote task-based information about using the API, including how to <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/#authentication" target="_blank">authenticate</a>, <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/#searching-for-media" target="_blank">search for media</a>, <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/#licensing-and-downloading" target="_blank">license and dowload media</a>, and <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/#searching-for-media-computer-vision-search" target="_blank">use Shutterstock's AI tools</a>.
</li>
<li>
Developed a Node.JS app to generate <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">these tech docs</a> from the API's OpenAPI spec and merge generated and handwritten code examples in four languages.
</li>
<li>
Maintained Shutterstock's <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/developers/documentation" target="_blank">developer portal</a> with information about the API and related tools for partners such as the company's single sign-on/federated identity offering.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="experienceResultBullet">
These docs reduced average partner integration time from 3 months to 1.2 months.
Partner feedback indicates that documentation is a major factor in getting integrations working quickly.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="experienceActionBullet">
Developed and maintained a modular documentation container that builds and publishes documentation for technical teams via GitHub Actions.
Coded the container, pipeline, deployment code, and tests using Gatsby, GraphQL, React, GitHub Actions, asynchronous JavaScript, and other open-source tools.
</div>
<div class="experienceResultBullet">
I onboarded documentation for 5 internal services onto this system in 2 months and eventually 13 services.
Overall, this container reduced the time that teams had to spend on tech docs because I could manage one platform instead of letting them manage 13.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="experienceActionBullet">
Built a diagram of Shutterstock's internal architecture, gathering information from each department and merging it into a format that makes sense across all departments.
</div>
<div class="experienceResultBullet">
Departments across the company use this diagram to diagnose outages and other urgent situations.
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="experienceActionBullet">
Documented internal Node.JS microservices and APIs to promote innersourcing and accelerate onboarding.
Hosted writing classes and working sessions to guide teams to make documenting their work part of their processes.
</div>
<div class="experienceResultBullet">
These tech docs reduced confusion when development teams worked across departments, reduced the amount of time experienced developers had to answer questions, and sped up the onboarding of new developers.
