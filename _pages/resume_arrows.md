Shutterstock's API documentation was scattered and confusing, making it difficult for partners to integrate with the platform and resulting in time-consuming meetings with Shutterstock solution engineers.

Developed and wrote <a href="https://api-reference.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">documentation for Shutterstock's public API</a>, SDK, CLI, and UI widgets by creating a pipeline to merge OpenAPI reference with manually written examples and task-oriented content.

These docs reduced average partner integration time from 3 months to 1.2 months.

Shutterstock's internal teams all used different platforms to build and publish technical documentations, causing duplicated effort and inconsistent quality.

Developed and maintained a modular documentation container that builds and publishes documentation for technical teams via GitHub Actions.
Coded the container, pipeline, deployment code, and tests using Gatsby, GraphQL, React, GitHub Actions, asynchronous JavaScript, and other open-source tools.

I onboarded documentation for 5 internal services onto this system in 2 months and eventually 13 services.
Overall, this container reduced the time that teams had to spend on tech docs because I could manage one platform instead of making them manage 13.
