Hi, I'm Tim.
Here's some info about me:

- I'm looking for my next job in software documentation.
Here's my [resume](./resume), and you can look me up on LinkedIn: [@timothymcmackin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothymcmackin/).

  Here's what I do:

  - Techical writing to simplify complicated software suites and guide users through their tasks
  - Documentation and coding to combine generated API/SDK reference with handwritten information and examples
  - Leadership for teams of technical writers

  I've got examples of my work in my [portfolio](./portfolio).

- I like kite flying and kite-surfing.
My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@timothymcmackin/videos) account has my kite videos and [this site](https://timothymcmackin.github.io/kite-site/) has my kite collection.

- I used to use Twitter as [@timothymcmackin](https://twitter.com/timothymcmackin) as my primary social media, but haven't been on Twitter lately.
The best way to get in touch with me is by email or LinkedIn.
