Hi, I'm Tim.
Here's some info about me:

- I'm looking for my next job in software documentation.
Here's my [resume](./resume) and my [portfolio](./portfolio), and you can look me up on LinkedIn: [@timothymcmackin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothymcmackin/).

  Here's what I do:

  - Technical writing to simplify complicated software suites and guide users through their tasks
  - Coding to publish technical information and combine generated API/SDK reference with handwritten information and examples
  - Leadership for teams of technical writers

  I've got examples of my work in my [portfolio](./portfolio).

- I like kite flying and kite-surfing, and I'm proud of being a national champion stunt kite pilot.
My [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYv6042iTX8&list=PLpDx-rmEnbuxnaXKmQslL_sj66lUKm_16&index=1) account has my kite videos and I am working on a [catalog of my kite collection](https://timothymcmackin.github.io/kite-site/).

- I used to use Twitter as [@timothymcmackin](https://twitter.com/timothymcmackin) as my primary social media, but I am moving to Mastodon, where I am [@timothymcmackin@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@timothymcmackin).
The best way to get in touch with me is by email or LinkedIn.
